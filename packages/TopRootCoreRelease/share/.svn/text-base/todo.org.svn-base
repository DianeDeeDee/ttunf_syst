** Run Number

Set a run number for an event after it is read in (using the pileup
reweighting tools function) so that the helper packages get a
consistent picture of the event. (i.e. so we don't derive one run
number for the muon corrections, one for the pileup etc. as currently
happens.).

The way this works exactly I don't know, particularly since the new
egamma SFs apparently require the data to be chopped into 3 periods,
not sure how this interplays with the run number from the D3PD, the
run number that can be retrieved from the pileup tool, and the period
additions in the pileup tool itself...

** JVF

New jvf cut of .5 needs to be updated

** LC Jets

Need to replace Antikt4 jets with LC jets everywhere.

* TODO Package Updates

** TopJetUtils-00-00-08

Interface changes?

** TopMuonSFUtils-00-00-16 & TrigMuonEfficiency-00-02-08

interface changes?

** egammaAnalysisUtils-00-03-33

changes? (i think it was just a bug fix)

** TopElectronSFUtils-00-00-20

Interface changes? Splits the data into 3?
